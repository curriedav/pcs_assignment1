Great work, David! My only suggestion is that you use consistent spacing within the
console.log() statement. On lines 7 and 8 you have no space between the opening/closing
parentheses and the argument. On lines 13 and 15 you've added an extra space. Either
of these styles are fine, but it's good to develop consistency about this sort of thing.

The other issue is that per the assignment discription this file needs to be named
'variables.js'

Terrific work overall!
